# Bills & Subscriptions

## Overview

The Bills & Subscriptions feature helps you track and manage your recurring payments, giving you better control over your monthly expenses and helping you identify opportunities to save money.

## Key Features

### Automatic Detection
$ave+ automatically scans your transaction history to detect recurring payments:
- Analyzes patterns in your spending
- Identifies merchants with regular charges
- Calculates payment frequency (weekly, monthly, annual)
- Estimates confidence level for each detection

### Subscription Management
- **Pause/Resume**: Temporarily pause subscriptions you want to keep but not pay for currently
- **Delete**: Remove subscriptions you no longer need
- **Status Tracking**: See which subscriptions are active, paused, or overdue
- **Quick Stats**: View total active bills, upcoming payments, and monthly totals

### Calendar Export
Export your bills to popular calendar apps:
- Generates standard .ics calendar files
- Includes all active subscriptions
- Sets up recurring events automatically
- Adds payment reminders (1 day before)
- Compatible with Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, and more

## How to Use

### Scanning for Bills

1. Navigate to **Bills & Subscriptions** from the Debts page
2. Click **"Scan for Bills"** button
3. $ave+ analyzes your transaction history (last 90 days)
4. New subscriptions appear automatically

### Understanding Confidence Scores

Each detected subscription has a confidence score (0-100%):
- **80-100%**: High confidence - likely accurate
- **50-79%**: Medium confidence - verify the pattern
- **Below 50%**: Low confidence - please review carefully

Low confidence subscriptions show a warning banner with the score.

### Managing Subscriptions

#### Pause a Subscription
Click the **Pause** button (⏸) on any subscription card. This marks it as inactive without deleting it.

#### Resume a Subscription
Click the **Play** button (▶) on any paused subscription to reactivate it.

#### Delete a Subscription
Click the **More** (⋮) button and select **Delete** to permanently remove it.

### Overdue Alerts

Subscriptions past their expected payment date show:
- Red left border indicator
- "Overdue by X days" warning
- Alert icon instead of dollar sign

### Export to Calendar

1. Click **"Export Calendar"** button
2. Save the `.ics` file when prompted
3. Import into your calendar app:
   - **Google Calendar**: Settings → Import & Export → Import
   - **Apple Calendar**: File → Import
   - **Outlook**: File → Open & Export → Import/Export

## Tips for Reducing Subscription Costs

### Review Regularly
- Check your subscriptions monthly
- Pause services you're not actively using
- Cancel duplicate services (e.g., multiple streaming platforms)

### Identify Wasteful Spending
Look for:
- Subscriptions you forgot about
- Services you signed up for trials and never cancelled
- Overlapping services (e.g., multiple cloud storage plans)

### Create a Bills Savings Goal
Set aside money each month for bills by:
1. Go to Goals page
2. Create a new goal for "Monthly Bills"
3. Set target to your monthly subscription total
4. Link auto-transfers from main account

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why wasn't my subscription detected?
Subscriptions may not be detected if:
- They're too new (less than 2 payments)
- Amounts vary significantly each time
- Payments come from different merchant names
- Transactions are older than 90 days

**Solution**: Manually add them by creating a transaction reminder or contact support.

### Can I edit subscription amounts?
Currently, subscriptions are auto-detected and amounts are calculated from your actual transactions. To correct an amount, delete the subscription and trigger a re-scan.

### What happens if I pause a subscription here but keep paying?
Pausing in $ave+ is for tracking purposes only. It doesn't cancel the actual subscription with the merchant. You must cancel directly with the service provider.

### How often should I scan for bills?
Run a scan:
- Monthly to catch new subscriptions
- After signing up for new services
- When you notice charges you don't recognize

### Why is the confidence score low?
Low confidence means the payment pattern is irregular:
- Amount varies between payments
- Payment dates are inconsistent
- Only 2-3 transactions detected
- Long gaps between payments

**Action**: Verify the subscription details and confirm or delete if inaccurate.

## Privacy & Security
